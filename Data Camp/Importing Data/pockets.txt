For wearers of women’s clothes, this struggle is so real. 
You don’t have to look far to find Twitter-rants, articles, and videos in which people are either complaining about not having pockets or rejoicing over that rare gem that is the “dress with pockets”.

Afterall, men’s pants pockets are basically the pockets of our dreams.
